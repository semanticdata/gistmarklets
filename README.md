# üîñ GistMarklets

A small tool designed to simplify the creation of **Bookmarklets** from GitHub Gists. You can achieve this simply by providing the Gist ID.

Take a look at the [DEMO](https://semanticdata.github.io/gistmarklets/).

## jQuery Bookmarlet Helper

The [jQuery Bookmarlet Helper](jquery.bookmarklet.js) file is a small plugin to help installing bookmarklets.

```js
$('a.bookmarklet').bookmarklet();
```

An object can be passed in to customize the appearance of the arrow. The options available are color, position and linewidth:

```js
$('a').bookmarklet({color: 'ff0000', position: 300, linewidth: 5})
```
