# ðŸ”– GistMarklets

A little tool to provide a simple installation page for bookmarklets hosted as gists.
The gist is identified by placing its id in the hash.

## ðŸ“… Planned Changes

- Make it so you can use whole Gist URL instead of just the Gist ID.
- Investigate using a single file from a Gist.
  This would allow users to have a single Gist with multiple bookmarklets.
